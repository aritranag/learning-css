# LearningCss

This project is a follow along project for udemy course [Advanced CSS and SASS](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/).
Once the course is completed, it will also contain various experiments that I will try and learn.
Feel free to use any code snippets found here. A mention would be appreciated.

## Technology

Angular - v11

To run - use `ng serve`. Will create an auto-reload web server at `http://localhost:4200/`. Standard stuff.
